					<p>
					If you're here it's because you're a bit more clever than the average viewer of this website. So I wanted to make sure that
					my message was heard, in case anything happens to me. Fact is, I think Tim is a mole, planted by either the CIA or the Kremlin.
					It's very possible it's Unit 6. To be honest I'm not sure, and am just.  .  . really scared. Jim has even gotten a little wary,
					we knew going into this it would be dangerous, and the number of stories we're just trying to shift through . . . it's enough to
					make your head spin.
					</p>

					<p>
					It's always been dangerous work. I've gotten dangerous notes since day one of the website going live at a PO box I opened with
					a fake ID that Jim gave me. It's located in Colorado, so you can probably guess where I am. My real name is Pamila, and I need that know.
					Because I'm not a afraid to die for the truth, but if a Pamila goes missing in Colorado, in particular one who's family calls her Mia,
					know that it's likely me, and that it's likely Tim that caused it.
					</p>

					<p>
					I always hope for the best, but in this line of work, the good ones that do their research almost always end up missing. That's why there
					are so many nutjobs spouting out nonsense about aliens out there. Jim told me that we know that there are other civilizations out there,
					but we are by far the most advanced, so we shouldn't expect any visitors. I mean that's just one example, there's also the nonsense about
					lizard people which is just silly. It's all so broken, and because of it the Illuminatis get to run around and cause global conflict
					all because the truth tellers get snuffed out.
					</p>

					<p>
					Sorry, I'm rabbling a bit. I guess I just want people to know who I am. As a bit of insurance. So that when and if I go, people will know
					why, and hopefully we can get a bit closer to knowing the truth, and holding those guilty accountable. Wish me luck~
					</p>

					<p>
					I'm going to need it.
