		<h2>Summary by Jim</h2>

		<p class="contentParagraph">
		I will explain Unit 6 as best I can, but please forgive me. I am very biased when it comes to this topic, as
		it was an imporant, even central, part of my life for nearly 20 years. It was only when I saw the changing
		direct of Unit 6, and the corruption in leadership, that I left, and began to reveal the organization,
		and it less than desirable actions.

					The history of Unit 6 is a long one. It predates the CIA, which it now is a part of, by several decades. It's an organization that was founded
					under President Lincoln. It's main goal was an ambitious one. To control emerging technologies, and make sure that they were not a threat to the
					United States, whether the threat was internal or external. In the early days it Unit 6 had a very small presence. They were underfuned, and largely
					focused on influencing different inventors to iteratively release their inventions. They largely took a hands off approach, only intervening when they
					felt like there was no other option. Nicholas Tesla is an example of one who they had to take an intervetion. 
					</p>

					<p>
					It wasn't until the 1940's, and the Third Reich that the advances in technology became of such grave concern,
					that the organization was integrated into the newly created CIA, and it grew exponentially in size, and got it's present name.
					It had traditionally been a part of the "Deep State",
					but it wasn't until this time that it truly came into it's own, becoming both as a research and intelligence organization. It effectively did two things,
					spied on and sabatoged the technologies of enemies of the United States, and influenced the creation of technology back home. Their common practice,
					was to collect so called "renagade technologies," and store them away until they felt like society would take in the technology safely.
					</p>

					<p>
					An example was the microprocessor, which was avalible to Unit 6 for nearly twenty years before it was released to the general population. Other technologies,
					such as GPS and telecomunications have been kept by them. They are roughly 20 years ahead of the general population at almost any time, and as technology has
					picked up, they've grown to be almost 100 years ahead in terms of technology.
					</p>

					<p>
					The pictures on this page are of equipment of Unit 6 agents, and facilities respectively. I took both of them personally, and can thus vouch for their authenticity.

					Unit 6's current organization was put together in the 1960s. There are three classes of operatives in Unit 6. The first class are known as agents. This was the role
					I filled while I was with the organization. We aren't that different than regular CIA agents, with our major differences being that we focused on finding emerging
					technologies that could be a threat to civil obedience or national security. We often posed as university professors, as a lot of us had expirence as security analysts
					and had enough experience to teach, and university were often close to emerging technologies.
					</p>

					<p>
					The second class of operatives were executives who helped contacts with corperate America. They worked out deals for delaying technology and missions for those
					deals they couldn't make. They're the ones behind global warming in conjunction with Chernobyl to prevent the world from advancing into an energy surplus. They
					do campains against emerging technologies they can't control to slow their progress, such as fracking.
					</p>

					<p>
					The final group of operatives are scientists. They were anyone that worked in a lab. They had people from all professions. Basically if it was a STEM course at university,
					it was part of the team. They worked day and night to develop new technologies, and reverse engineer technologies that we had reclaimed. They would project a technology's impact
					on society at large, and the likelihood of threat based on socioeconomic issues of the time.
					</p>

					<p>
					No one had real names, and were almost exclusively refered to by number. Within a strike team you might have nicknames, but outside of your daily co-workers you were refered to by
					operative type and then number. I was A0097B, or agent zero zero nine seven beta. One of my best friends was S8877Z, or scientist eight eight seven seven zed.

				I left the organization somewhere between 2005-2011. Mostly because politics had moved in, and it was becoming less and less about being a check and balance against
				overzelous technology and futurists, and more about control and power. The executives had always been the ones pulling the strings, but from the time I joined,
				until I left, I had never questioned their motives, mostly because they didn't give me a reason to. They had always done right by me, and their focus was the
				focus that the organization had from it's inception. However when Unit 6 did next to nothing to slow down or stop the advent of social media, it was the last straw for me.
				It was a clear and dangerous technology that could easily exploit people. That and the whole fiasco with Mr. Snowden. So I left, and hid out of the country for a few years,
				until an old contact got me a new identity, and I've been back in the states ever since. Now I spend most of my days trying to parse through files that other agents send me,
				trying to verify their veracity. The crazy thing is, even though I was a pretty high ranking agent with a pretty stellar record, there's so much I don't know. Unit 6 was strictly
				compartmentalized and everything, and I mean literally everything, was on a need to know basis.
				</p>

				<p>
				There are a few case files on this website that deal with Unit 6's dealings, but they are really just the very tip of a very large iceberg.
				Believe me, we touched everything. We knew the truth about bigfoot (he's a fake), the moon landing(it's real
				and could have happened 20 years earlier because Unit 6 had the tech), and where Hitler died (South America 5 years after the offical end of the war).
				The CIA itself is infiltrated with agents from Unit 6. We got involved in everything, and would be the textbook definition of the deep state.
