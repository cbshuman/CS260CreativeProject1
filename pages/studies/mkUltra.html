					So what was Project MKUltra? Simply put, it was a project put together by the CIA using it's varrious shadow organizations. It's purpose,
					discovering the secrets of mind-control. Yes really, and it got some results. It's also famous for exposing a very small peice of the
					deep state, and almost brought Unit 6 out into the light as well. That didn't happen, as all documents about Unit 6's involvment in MKUltra,
					were either destroyed or hidden. Below is an example of one of the documents laying out budgets for an LSD expiriement.

					MKUltra is best known for it's flagrant abuses of human rights and medical research standards. It was proven by many of the documents found
					in raids of the CIA that the progam had few bounds, including but not limited to, animal abuse, the sexual abuse of children. It's a big black mark on both
					the CIA and the United States, especially since it's main targets were citizens of the United States and Canada. It's gross negligence is
					very clear for all to see. It and other programs like MKNAOMI, and MKDelta, were gross abuses of the trust of the intelligence comunity, and
					sadly have erroded the public's trust in them. They show that organizations like the CIA need tight oversight by good men, who don't lose sight of
					their main goal and who the enemy is.

					Once the liquid was discovered scientists attemped to use instuments, like thermeters and other metal instuments, to get some information on
					the newly discovered goop. All instuments not made of glass, were instantly absorbed into the goo. It appeared to "feed" on these instuments,
					and grew larger and larger with each attempt to read it's composition and makeup.
