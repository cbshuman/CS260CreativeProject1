					So what was Project MKUltra? Simply put, it was a project put together by the CIA using it's varrious shadow organizations. It's purpose,
					discovering the secrets of mind-control. Yes really, and it got some results. It's also famous for exposing a very small peice of the
					deep state, and almost brought Unit 6 out into the light as well. That didn't happen, as all documents about Unit 6's involvment in MKUltra,
					were either destroyed or hidden. Below is an example of one of the documents laying out budgets for an LSD expiriement.
					</p>

					<p>
					MKUltra is best known for it's flagrant abuses of human rights and medical research standards. It was proven by many of the documents found
					in raids of the CIA that the progam had few bounds, including but not limited to, animal abuse, kidnapping, sexual abuse, and the sexual abuse of children.
					It's a big black mark on both the CIA and the United States government, especially since it's main targets were citizens of the United States and
					it's very close ally Canada. It's gross negligence is
					very clear for all to see. It and other programs like MKNAOMI, and MKDelta, were gross abuses of the trust of the intelligence comunity, and
					sadly have erroded the public's trust in them. They show that organizations like the CIA need tight oversight by good men, who don't lose sight of
					their main goal and who the enemy is.
					</p>

					<p>
					Many different expiriments were run on MKUltra subjects. One particularly. . . humorous, (if you are a particularly morbid person) example was
					"Opperation Midnight Climax", where CIA agents got a man high on LSD, and put him in a room with a hooker to observe the effects of the drug
					on sexual stimulation. The poor guy usually just went crazy. They preyed on several low-life type of individuals. Those that could not fight back,
					or would cooperate because they were scared of retribution. Mentally ill patients, prosititutes, and drug addicts. While most people were given LSD
					and other mind-altering drugs unwillingly, some were given them willingly, and were put through incredibly dangerous expiriements. One extreme example is
					where paticipents of a Kentucky study were given LSD for 27 consecutive days.
					</p>

					<p>
					MKUltra left a slew of corpse and severly damaged individuals in it's wake. It's not entirely clear just how many, but the numbers are rather high for
					an organization who's goal should have been to protect it's people.

					The truly terrifying left in the wake of MKUltra is the fact that it's far from over. Believe me when I tell you that MKUltra was a fall guy
					for the much, much more dark side of the deep state. I'm not the only one, there are plenty of others who have testified, some in front of Congress,
					about how the discoveries made around the MKUltra drug are just the tip of a very big iceburg.
					</p>

					<p>
					For example there's the abomination that is Polybius. It's become a bit of an urban myth that an arcade machine showed up around the time of 
					MKUltra and gave a few kids night terrors. Truth was it was a testing station to see how effective a new aerosol distributor of LSD worked.
					The machine would release a small amound of LSD into the air when the subject inserted their quarter into the machine. It would do this about
					every other game, however due to the fact that the aerosol clung to solid sufaces, almost anyone who came near the machine would get a dose,
					and around 85% of the subjects were kids, and most of the trips were really, really bad. Not to mention Polybius the game itself was meant
					to look like a really flash version of the arcade classic tempest, and was to effectively be an aproximation of an LSD trip in and of itself. 
					</p>

					<p>
					Unit 6 also had it's hands in MKUltra research. It was the main producer of the drug, which it used other organizations as a cover should the
					project get discovered. It also housed the labs where the drug. 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate or BZ, also known as the successor to LSD as
					"the mind controlling drug." Unit 6 labs also developed many other drugs that were tested all the way up into the 90's, long after the
					MKUltra documents were exposed. It wasn't until 1998 that the final tests were completed as it was realized that drugs were not going
					to be the solution to getting intelligence, but instead electronics. Unit 6 also had some documents connecting it with Scottland Yard,
					showing that there was a fair amount of collaboration between the Western Intelligence agencies.
					</p>

					<p>
					The legacy of MKUltra for Unit 6 was the creation of MKOmega, which was a mindcontrolling chip developed over the last twenty years. While still in
					beta state, it has been used to control large mammals such as dogs, and a version made for humans is under current development within Unit 6. It is currently
					unknown if the organization is still seeking human test subjects, or if they have focused on volenteer agents within Unit 6.
