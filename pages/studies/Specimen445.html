					<h1>Speciment 445</h1>

					<h2>Written by Tom</h2>

					<hr>

					<p>
					Speciment 445 was an interesting case. It starts with a hidden facility that Unit 6 was using about an hour outside of Boulder
					Colorado. This facility was like most of Unit 6's facilities, ahead of it's time. It was a super collider facility, much like
					the super haydron collider, only about three times the size of that facility. The location was named Unit 655, and probably
					warrents it's own case file, but so far the only confirmed case is Speciment 445 as it's the only one that I've been able
					to confirm documentation on.
					</p>

					<p>
					In any case from what we have on Unit 655, is that it was a state of the art facility. It had a cafeteria, a bunker, and a
					helicopter hanger, all underground. It was built in the 1940's, and was a big contributer on the Manhattan project research.
					It had a train, and three story parking garage for transportation. It's unknown where exactly the location was, and we can only
					confirm this location's existance because a trusted source has confirmed that he has been there at least twice in it's hayday in the 1960's.
					</p>

					<p>
					So anyway, this was a top notch place. Lots and lots of nuclear research came out of this place. It conducted hundreds and hundreds of expiriements,
					and becuase of their reseach we got the hydrogen bomb and the nuclear reactor among other things. We've had a few people report that they may have even
					found a way to do cold fusion, but we have nothing to confirm this.
					</p>

					<p>
					What we do have is clear documentation of Speciment 455. A class 4B inorganic. Highly dangerous, and hard to contain.
