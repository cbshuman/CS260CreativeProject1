		<h1>Specimen 445</h1>
		<h2>Summary by Tom</h2>

					<p>
					Specimen 445 was an interesting case. It starts with a hidden facility that Unit 6 was using about an hour outside of Boulder
					Colorado. This facility was like most of Unit 6's facilities, ahead of it's time. It was a super collider facility, much like
					the super haydron collider, only about three times the size of that facility. The location was named Unit 655, and probably
					warrents it's own case file, but so far the only confirmed case is Specimen 445 as it's the only one that I've been able
					to confirm documentation on.
					</p>

					<p>
					In any case from what we have on Unit 655, is that it was a state of the art facility. It had a cafeteria, a bunker, and a
					helicopter hanger, all underground. It was built in the 1940's, and was a big contributer on the Manhattan project research.
					It had a train, and three story parking garage for transportation. It's unknown where exactly the location was, and we can only
					confirm this location's existance because a trusted source has confirmed that he has been there at least twice in it's hayday in the 1960's.
					</p>

					<p>
					So anyway, this was a top notch place. Lots and lots of nuclear research came out of this place. It conducted hundreds and hundreds of expiriements,
					and becuase of their reseach we got the hydrogen bomb and the nuclear reactor among other things. We've had a few people report that they may have even
					found a way to do cold fusion, but we have nothing to confirm this.
					</p>

					<p>
					What we do have is clear documentation of Specimen 455. A class 4B inorganic. Highly dangerous, and hard to contain.
					</p>

					<p>
					Specimen 445 was discovered after an expiriment where they used the collider to collide some gold and another heavy metal,
					which has been redacted from the version of the document we have, at high speeds. The expiriment was colliding large quanties of
					these particles at super high speed. When they collieded most of the matter was converted to energy, and when the energy had dispersed,
					a thick glowing organge liquid. It had a similar viscosity to motor oil, and the  This liquid was highly caustic, and ate through the floor of the building.

					<p>
					Once the liquid was discovered scientists attemped to use instuments, like thermeters and other metal instuments, to get some information on
					the newly discovered goop. All instuments not made of glass, were instantly absorbed into the goo. It appeared to "feed" on these instuments,
					and grew larger and larger with each attempt to read it's composition and makeup.
					</p>

					<p>
					Eventually it was captured in a glass vial, and taken to an onsite lab, numbered 005, for observation, and more analysis. In the process of
					containment, a scientist reportedly lost a hand in the process of containment when it ate through his glove.
					Once in the lab, the first thing they attempted was an X-ray, but the results were inconclusive. The reason is because 
					the Specimen appeared as a solid black blotch on the X-ray. They then seperated the liquid into seperate vials, and used several different
					materials to see what could be abosorbed. Consistantly the goo would absorb anything that wasn't glass. The facinating part was the absorbtion
					rate was nearly 95%, meaning that the mass of Specimen 445 grew by 95% of the mass of the object fed to it.
					</p>

					<p>
					In the meantime, the scientist that lost his hand was consistantly feeling pain on his wrist near where the liquid had touched him. The doctors treating
					him discovered that his arm was about 3 inches shorter than when he had come in, and that his blood was thinning. He was also feeling a burning sensation
					throughout his body. As he was reporting his discomfort, a nurse noticed a caustic orange liquid eating the sheets on his bed. Immediately he was moved to
					quarantine, and his room was checked throughly for additional traces of Specimen 445.
					</p>

					<p>
					Meanwhile in lab 005, it was discovered that samples of the substance began to react when fed the same material repeatedly. It would move up the vial,
					as if to reach out. It also reacted and absorbed material when fed organic substances such as wood. It was discovered that in particular it enjoyed organic material
					such as meat or other foods. The cafeteria's soup of the day happened to be tomato, and it was quickly and efficiently absorbed. The scientists also discovered
					that when hit with radioactivity Specimen 445 grew proportionally to the radiation given.

			The man in quarantine in meanwhile, began to report that his pain had increased and began to halucinate. His IV had small traces of an orange liqud within it.
			He was determined to be beyond saving, and plans to place him, and the samples from the lab, into a glass tank began to be made immediately. Everyone in the facility
			were told to prepare for a nuclear meltdown, and to make sure every part of their bodies were covered. The entire facility was then checked for the substance, and
			whole chunks of the facility were removed when the liquid, or even the appearance of the liquid, was spotted. It was reported that an orange juice spill was spotted
			in the cafeteria and was subsequently removed. It was required by everyone to work into the night to make sure that the liquid did not grow to a point where the facility
			would have to be abandoned. They worked through the night for almost three complete days, and the facility was only considered completely safe after about a week.
			</p>

			<p class="contentParagraph">
			The inital sample of Specimen 445 was weighed to be around 3 grams. After it was completely contained it was around 500 kilograms. It was placed in a sealed glass tank,
			where it had nothing to eat. After a week the scientists discovered that it had eaten all of the air in the tank, and had effectively vaccum-sealed itself into the tank.
			From what measurements they could make, the scientists believe that it had created a true perfect vaccum, though they could not test it as the seal was far too tight,
			and being a class 4B, they weren't allowed to open it anyway as a class 4B by nature would have constituted a global risk outside of containment. It was later placed
			inside of three layers of bullet resistant glass, and moved to a true containment site later that year.
