					This one is a bit silly, and really . . . really dumb. Basically the CIA partnered with a big Hasbro toymaker named Donald Levine
					who is best known for creating a relatively unknown toy called "G.I. Joe." For real people, a doll that actually made it out into the wild
					was just sold at auction for 5000 USD.
					</p>

					<p>
					The crazy idea that inspired this crazy doll is when the CIA was providing relief to areas that the Taliban was trying to control,
					they came up with a crazy propaganda idea. Create a doll of their enemy, and give it to families with children. Brilliant! Now the kids get their
					own terrorist doll to play with! Now comes the crazy part, the paint on the face was supposed to be made to fade off after use, revealing that
					the terrorist leader was actually a demon! This really happened people, it's on the web from several reputable news organizations.
					</p>

					<p>
					The plug was reportedly pulled on this project. Likely because the finished faceless doll just looked like Darth Maul being portrayed by Bin Laden,
					and what little boy doesn't think that Darth Maul looks freaking cool? Just remember that this is what the deep state cooks up with your tax dollars.
