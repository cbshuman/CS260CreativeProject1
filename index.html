			<h1> Hello and Welcome</h1>

			<h2>I will warn you, viewer discression is advised</h2>

			<hr>

			<p>
				Discression isn't advised because of what some might call normal circumstances. No it's not because the stuff in here is graphic.
				It's not because the stuff in here is unnerving. That we believe comes with the territory and most people know what they're getting
				into, and if they're easily spooked to read durring the day, or with the lights on. No, that's not the reason.
				<br><br>			
				The real reason for your discression dear reader, is because the stories on here are real.
				Some might call this a conspiracy theory website. A conspiracy theory is just that, a theory.
				With these, there are a few facts that have the <i>appearance</i> of being connected. In the end though, there isn't enough
				evidence to make the theory complete. These are facts. They aren't theories. They aren't crazy. The purpose of this website
				is to bring together documents that weren't supposed to see the light of day. It's not to speculate, or discuss what <i>might</i>
				be, but instead discuss what actually <i>is</i>.
				<br><br>
				There will be those that come here and make theories. Fine, using your head to fill in the gaps isn't discouraged here. However,
				We are only trying to bring to light that which has been hidden. Some peices are funny, some are terrifying, all were meant to
				be hidden from the public view. The goal here is to uncover the cover-ups. To bring revelations. Everything here has been throughly
				vetted. We do have men on the inside. Some of them are well known, some are nobodies with big friends. All have to keep their mouths
				shut or they'll end up missing. Please continue, but do it at your own risk.
				<br><br>
				If you're still not spooked, or just really want to know the truth after all this. Please go to our about page to learn more about us, and our team.
